# Adqui-DAQS-Test
This is a DAQ system-probes-repository, the intention here is to make a GUI that allow the user to perform data aquisition through serial port with arduino

Data is collected from the circuit's input and output voltage as well as time measurements.
This data will be then plotted and written into an ASCII file. In order to measure time, there must be a period of time at which the data aqcuisition will last, as well as the sammpling frecquency and last but not least the type and magnitude (if needed) of the circuit's input signal. In which the last recquierements are user-defined parameters.
